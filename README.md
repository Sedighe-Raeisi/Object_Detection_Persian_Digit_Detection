# Object_Detection_Persian_Digit_Detection
This repository consists of three parts. 
1- A draft of the first, successful effort
2- A classifier 
3- A function
You can ignore the draft, it was my first successful classifier. unfortunately, it wasn't saved in my personal space. Therefore, I missed it. 
2- classifier is a model that recognizes between the Persian digits and non-Persian digits. in the final part of this notebook, you can see a function that performs all the task automatically. 
3- I separated the function that can recognize between Persian digits objects in images and other objects. this function needs two paths, one belongs to the image and the other belongs to the classifier model.
